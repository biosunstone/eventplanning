## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (>= 3.0.0)
- Dart SDK (>= 2.17.0)
- Android Studio / VS Code
- iOS Simulator / Android Emulator

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
3. Run `flutter run` to start the development server
4. The app will generate demo data automatically on first launch

### Demo Data
The app includes comprehensive demo data generation for:
- Sample events with realistic details
- Multiple attendee profiles with professional information
- Session schedules with speakers and content
- Registration data with various ticket types
- Analytics data with realistic metrics
- Networking connections and interactions

## üîß Configuration

### Database
- Uses SQLite for local data storage
- Automatic demo data generation
- Service layer abstraction for easy backend integration

### Services
Each major feature has a dedicated service class:
- `EventService` - Event management

## üìà Scaling Considerations

### Backend Integration
The current implementation uses local SQLite storage with service layer abstraction. To scale to production:

1. **API Integration** - Replace service implementations with REST/GraphQL APIs
2. **Real-time Features** - Implement WebSocket connections for live features
3. **Cloud Storage** - Add cloud storage for photos and documents
4. **Push Notifications** - Integrate push notification services
5. **Payment Gateway** - Connect to payment processors (Stripe, PayPal)
6. **Video Streaming** - Integrate with streaming services (Agora, Zoom)

### Performance Optimization
